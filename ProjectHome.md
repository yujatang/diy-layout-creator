<b>DIYLC is provided free of charge and can be used and redistributed freely. However, it takes a lot of time and effort to build and maintain it, as well as to respond to all your questions and feature requests. Time I could have spent doing stuff that pays, playing guitar or simply enjoying my free time. If you find DIYLC useful and want to support the project, please consider making a small PayPal donation. Every little bit counts!<br>
If you have some extra parts, transistors, tubes, ICs, caps, anything useful for a fellow DIYer, I'll gladly accept a donation in parts.</b>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

DIY Layout Creator (DIYLC in short) is freeware drawing tool developed with help of a large online community of DIY electronics enthusiasts. It incorporates many ideas that came from people using older versions of the application. The goal is to provide a simple interface and enough power to let the user draw schematics, board/chassis layouts and guitar wiring diagrams quickly and without a steep learning curve.<br>
Also, it is build around the flexible open source framework that may be used to draw pretty much anything. Below is a sample board layout drawn in DIYLC3.<br>

<h3>Brief project history</h3>

<ul><li><b>Version 3</b> is the current version and was re-written from scratch starting early 2010, but this time as an open source project. It incorporates all the ideas that were accumulated over years and also better code architecture. That should provide better user experience, less bugs and code that's easier to maintain and extend.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Version 2</b> was re-written from scratch in Java mid 2007 and is platform independent. Unfortunately, it's not very fast and is not backward compatible with version 1 which means that it cannot open files created with version 1. It was my first ever Java project, so code is was so great which is why I gave it up at some point.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Version 1</b> started its life in May 2005 and was written in Delphi. As such, it only works on windows machines (or through emulators). There's a large collection of layouts submitted by users for this version which is why it's still kept around.</li></ul>
